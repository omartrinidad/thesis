\section{Introduction}

Knowledge bases (KB) have the purpose of representing and store knowledge in a
machine-readable format. Some well-known KBs are DBpedia~\cite{dbpedia-swj},
NELL, YAGO~\cite{suchanek2007yago}, or Freebase~\cite{bollacker2008freebase}. A
usual task executed in these databases is mining logical rules, that is, find
unknown relationships between entities. For example,

\begin{equation*}
livesIn(a, x) and marriedTo(a, b) => livesIn(b, x)
\end{equation*}

However,  these databases are designed under the idea of Open World Assumption
(OWA), that means, if the database does not contain a fact, we are not assuming
that this fact is false, as happens under the Closed World Assumption (CWA).

Finding these relations in huge datasets, and under the OWA setting is a
challenging task. This problem was addressed by Gal√°rraga et al. who proposed
Association Rule Mining under Incomplete Evidence (AMIE) and later suggested an
improved version of the same method that they simple named AMIE+.

The purpose of the current project is to explore AMIE+ and implement it in a
distributed context.

\subsection{Theory}

Knowledge Bases $KB$ are collections of facts; every fact is represented by a
relation between a subject and object $r(s, o)$.

\subsection{AMIE}

Inside AMIE, the Partial Completeness Assumption (PCA) was used to guess the
so-called counterexamples for rules. 


In the PCA we say that a subject-relation pair is complete if it does exists
an object that for that s,r.

Assume that if the KB knows relations for some subject then knows all the set
of values.

%\subsubsection{Completeness}
%Lets say that $KB*$ contains every fact of the world.

\subsection{AMIE plus}

In AMIE+ it was aggregated pruning strategies and approximations that allowed
to explore the search space more efficiently.
